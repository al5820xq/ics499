						<h5 class="w3-center">Established since 2021</h5>
						<p class="w3-large"> PetSource was founded in Minnesota, USA in August 2021. We've created this website to solve an ongoing problem within the Pet Community - missing pets! </p>
						<p class="w3-large"> We decided to create a tool where pet owners will be able to post their lost pets. Not only will you be able to post your lost pet but pet finders will have the ability
							to contact you.
						</p>
						<p class="w3-large">Our vision is to provide an easy and efficient site that helps lost pets find their way back home. Together we can help lost pets get back to their families, safe and sound.</p>
